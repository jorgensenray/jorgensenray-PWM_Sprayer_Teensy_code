# jorgensenray-PWM_Sprayer_Teensy_code

A working, cost effective PWM sprayer.

Features include; -  On/Off valve control  -  PWM valve control  -  Turn compensation  -  Staggered valve control  -  User definable Hz up to 15 and possibly higher.

The solenoid: If you read far enough it’s rated for 50 million cycles. At 10 Hz running 24 hrs a day that is just under 58 days.  It only draws .4 amps in my testing. I can measure 15 Hz and I’m sure it will cycle faster.

Optional but recommended is an INA219 current sensor.

This AOG compatible controller will cost $40 for a Teensy 4.1 W/Ethernet that will get you 30+ individually controlled nozzles. If you need more than that, let’s talk.  Need a PCB or just make one with perfboard.  I’ll design one and post it on Git.

So you’re just shy of $100 in these parts.

You need a PWM driver for each valve at a cost of around $10.  (Digikey thru hole parts). or JLC SMD components - assembled $6 plus shipping.

 The negatives would be that the components aren’t designed for ag chemicals and won’t last.  At $6.95 you can replace a valve a bunch of times before you’re even money with a Raven/Capstan or your favorite flavor of valve.
